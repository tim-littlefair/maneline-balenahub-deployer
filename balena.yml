  Application to support control of selected modelling guitar amplifiers
  sold by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) which are capable 
  of being controled over USB interfaces.
    
  Provides a web user interface for viewing and selecting presets (i.e.
  particular configured amplifier/effect combinations) and exposes USB 
  traffic in log files and JSON preset configuration files
  extracted from the USB traffic.  
  
  This is an open source application, and the developer is not affiliated 
  with FMIC in any way.  Users choosing to experiment with this application
  with their FMIC-supplied equipment do so with no warranty from the developer.
    
  The following YouTube playlist contains videos demonstrating the 
  use of the application on two different FMIC amplifiers, and 
  also shows the software build/deployment process on the development 
  platform:
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeAWGhOp0MEoWJEE42cSzxjEoNR-tcFce.
  
  The application provides an alternative to two different first party 
  companion applications published by FMIC for different ranges of amp models:
  
  - Fender FUSE for macOS/Windows
  
    This program interoperated with the Mustang I, II, III, IV and V models
    on sale from around 2012 to 2016 and the version 2 variants of the same 
    model numbers sold from around 2016 to 2019.
  
  - Fender TONE LT Desktop for macOS/Windows
  
    This program interoperates with the Rumble LT25, Mustang LT25, LT50 and LT40S 
    models sold from around 2020.
  
  Although the application is expected to interoperate with all of the models
  listed above, so far it has only been tested with the following models:
  - Mustang I version 2
  - Mustang LT40S 
  
  Reports of success or failure with other models from these ranges would be 
  very welcome and can be made by adding comments to the following GitHub
  discussion: https://github.com/tim-littlefair/maneline/discussions/14.

  Both ranges of amplifiers supported at by the application at present 
  receive control commands from the application over a wired USB interface.
  Other modelling amplifier ranges sold by Fender recently and currently 
  have physical USB connections for firmware updating only, but do not 
  accept control commands over that interface - the companion applications
  for these are implemented as in the FenderTONE mobile application for 
  iOS/Android, and control commands are sent over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
  Model ranges interoperable with the mobile applications include the 
  GT-, GTX-, LTX- series and the headphone plug Mustang Micro Plus (MMP)
  product. Maneline does not support any of these at present.
  
  I hope that a future version of this application will be able to restore 
  previously captured JSON preset configurations, making the application a 
  solution for local backup and sharing of presets.  Adding support for 
  controlling the highly portable MMP product over BLE is also under 
  consideration.

  ## Usage instructions

  If you have a monitor attached to your device, when the application starts up it should
  display a splash screen which includes the http URL of the web server which provides
  the control UI and a 2D barcode which can be scanned for that URL.   
  
  The application will also operate OK without a monitor attached, but in this case you 
  need to discover the numeric IP address of the device and convert it to a URL of the 
  form http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:8080.
